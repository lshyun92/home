# Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Finance at the University of Texas at Austin, McCombs School of Business. 

My primary research area is empirical corporate finance, with a particular emphasis on municipal and public finance. I also have a strong interest in institutional investors and financial intermediation.
