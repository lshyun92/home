# The Real Effects of Debt Relief: Evidence from Independent School Districts in Texas.

Abstract: U.S. school districts face pressing needs for facility improvements, yet limited debt capacity hampers their ability to raise sufficient capital for these projects. I study how debt assistance affects educational outcomes through increased capital investment in debt-strapped districts. Using a novel quasi-natural experiment, I find that debt support increases capital spending by 22%, leading to substantial long-term improvements in educational outcomes, including higher test scores and graduation rates. The findings suggest that state intervention in debt capacity can produce long-run positive effects by revitalizing previously forgone high-impact projects.
