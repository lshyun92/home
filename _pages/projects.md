# Investing in Schools: How Debt Relief Helps Students Succeed through Better Facilities

## Summary
This study examines how capital spending affects educational outcomes in debt-laden school districts. Using a quasi-natural experiment with Texas debt relief programs, I find that state-supported infrastructure investments significantly improve student performance and graduation rates. The results highlight the long-term benefits of financial intervention in school districts with limited debt capacity.

## Problem Statement
How does capital spending in debt-laden school districts impact educational outcomes?

## Data Sources
- Texas Education Agency (TEA): K-12 individual student outcomes and school district finances.
- Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB): College enrollment data.
- National Center for Education Statistics (NCES): School district income statement information.
- U.S. Census Data â€“ Local economic indicators.

## Methodology

## Key Findings
1. Impact of Debt Relief on Capital Spending
- Debt relief programs increased capital spending by $570 per student (+22% over 3 years).

2. Educational Outcomes
- Test Scores:
A $1,000 increase per pupil in capital spending raised 8th-grade reading scores by 0.06 and math scores by 0.12 standard deviations.
Effects were delayed but long-lasting, with gains materializing 5+ years post-investment.
- Graduation & Attendance:
Graduation rates increased by 1.9 percentage points.
Attendance rates improved by 0.12 percentage points.
- College & Labor Market Outcomes:
Small but positive effects on college entrance exam participation (+1.3 p.p.) and college enrollment (+0.9 p.p.).
Early-career earnings increased by ~2% per year for non-college-educated students
